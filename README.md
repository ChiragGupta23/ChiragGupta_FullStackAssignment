#### As discussed for the Login and Registration assignment, I have created RESTful API in .NET framework using C# and for database I have used MSSQL.

Firstly, I have made an User Registration API in which the user will register providing the basic details and a suitable password which will be stored in the database in encrypted form using hash and salt method.

Then the login API will take the provided username and password, compare it with the already stored credentials and then generate the token or throw the status code accordingly.

This code was written using Visual Studio 2022, and in order to run this program, the user need to have SQL Server Management Studio installed and take the desired "connection string" of the database and replace it with the already existing connection string in the AppSetting.json file, in order to store the details of the registered user in the database.

Thank You!
